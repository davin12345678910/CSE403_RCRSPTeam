# Week 9 status report for Sahil

## Team report:
### Status update:
Overall out team has been able to refactor out codebase to be more readable on the backend. In addition, we now have a website where users can simply
put in the link and start using our application. We however, do not have all
of the user names and passwords for all people, which prevented users from
peer reviews to login and we hope to solve this issue later.


### Agenda for thursday's meeting:
We will be going over the final use cases that we will need to implement, and discuss any use cases that we do not think we can do. And we will be discussing them with Sahil. We will also be discussing the suggestions that we will be getting from peer reviews in order to see what some potential users thought about our application.

## Contributions of team memebers:

### Davin Win Kyi:

what I did:
I helped with the commenting of the methods, endpoints and tests.
I also assisted with the public release of the backend code for our website.

what I learned:
I learned about hosting a public server. I also learned about various commenting techniques in javascript, which overall are quite similar to the commenting techniques of java code.

What I had trouble on:
We had trouble hosting the backend code initally, but were eventually
able to figure it out

What I am stuck on:
Getting a way to have changes in the code, but it not crashing or impacting the public website. This is something that we can fix by having pull request, which our team unfortunately did not do


### Azaan Khalfe
what I did:
I helped hosting the project and adding comments to the backend portion.

what I learned:
I learned how to host a project and what is needed to host a project.


What I had trouble on:
I had trouble on trying to host get everything needed for hosting the project.

What I am stuck on:
Just finalizing the project and seeing what we ant to add.


### Ahmed Helow
what I did:
I helped with hosting the website for the peer review assignment. 


what I learned:
I learned how to peer review other projects and comment on the structure of the repository. I also learned how to host a website. 


What I had trouble on:
We had trouble hosting the website publicly at the beginning. 



What I am stuck on:
We are now in the process of making the code be more readable by adding comments and helper functions. 



### Chairnet Muche
what I did:
I helped with setting up the host and helped with the comments making sure that the required comments are done on the front-end side of the project.

what I learned:
I learned that hosting a project on a website takes time and effort when especially trying to host for both the back end and the front end at the same time.

What I had trouble on:
I had trouble hosting the site but with the help of group members, we were able to host it.

What I am stuck on:
I am still not sure what we need to add for our final project,  because we only have about one week to do it. And I think we need to choose which last cases to add to our project before finalizing it.


### Foad Shariat
what I did:
I did some of the commenting for teh front end and also improved the add code and waitlist functionality

what I learned:
I learned how to use github functions and also working better with backend

What I had trouble on:
I had trouble on sending and recieving data with the backend in some point

What I am stuck on:
Nothing specific. I'm not stuck on anything.


### Sol Zamora
What I did:
I began working on one of the final use cases: automating the waitlist system such that students are scheduled in a manner that doesn't allow scheduling conflicts. This means redesigning the 'classes' data table and modifying all affected functions.

What I learned:
I learned how to implement a Queue-like data structure in SQL. I also learned that SQL data tables can store many more columns of data than I initially thought.

What I had trouble on:
I had trouble refactoring the code that was dependent on the 'classes' data table working as it did previously. Since the table was changed, every function and query that accessed that data table also had to be changed.

What I am stuck on:
I am stuck working on a method to disallow students from adding themselves to the waitlist for every class.


## Plans for next week:
1. work on final endpoints
2. finalize the back end
3. include final touches to the front end
