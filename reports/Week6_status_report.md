# Week 6 status report for Sahil

## Team report:
### Status update:
- As an update we have compelted the CI and automated testing infrastructure of our code base.
- We have also completed a basic webpage outline for our website and have completed a good
  portion of the webpages for our website
- We have also completed most of the endpoints for one table in our codebase and we hope to do the
  same for the rest of the tables which should be easy since they are quite repetitive
- We have decided on a weekly meeting time

### Agenda for tuesday's meeting
1. We will be discussing the main changes we have to the CI and the server, and keep both
   subteams up to date in terms of what each team has accomplished and has completed
2. We will discuss any more needed endpoints that we will be needing for our frontend developers
3. We will be discussing the layout of the webpages that the front end team has came up with and we
   will ssee if there is any disagreement in terms of the webpages in which the front end
   team has made
4. We will be discussing any bugs or conflicts that have arisen in the codebase or any failures
   on the CI


## Contributions of team memebers:

### Davin Win Kyi:

what I did:
I learned how to set up test automation for node.js. I also learned how to use jest and supertest
which was the way in which we did the test automation. I also learned how to use github actions
which i never really used, and now i see the usefulness it has for projects

what I learned:
I learned that setting up the CI isn't always easy, and even if you have done it for something before
the setup might not be the same since you might be using new or different languages and automated
testing.

What I had trouble on:
I had trouble figuring out this exception where we had the CI run forever, but we have luckily figured
out the issue. The issue mainly had to do with the fact that we had an issue with two testing directories
in the front end and the back end, and since the front end was not implemented we got issues with the
test not stopping. And this was mainly because we had yet to setup the test for the front end.

What I am stuck on:
I am currently working on the front end testing infrastructure which we have decided to have as selenium
since it is one of the most reliable and has a lot of resources about it online.

   which we are working with
