# Week 7 status report for Sahil

## Team report:
### Status update:
1. We have completed the main endpoints that are needed for our registration system
2. We have completed our first user story, a user story where users are able to see the
   GPA and ratings of a professor and a course
3. We have finished the basic front end structure for our website
4. We have also completed the testing of all the main endpoints in which we had in mind


### Agenda for tuesday's meeting:
1. We will be discussing new endpoints we will need in order to save the courses and the
   sections in which a student has signed up for, which we did not have the time to do
2. We will be discussing the front end componenets in which we will need to build for future
   user stories that we have yet to implement
3. We will distributing tasks for the two points mentioned above


## Contributions of team memebers:

### Davin Win Kyi:

what I did:
I worked on the main endpoints that we needed to complete for our registration system.
I also worked on the edge cases that we had for the front end

what I learned:
I learned about yml files more, as we did run into more issues as we added in more
endpoints that had more requirments
I also learned about CORs errors and why they occur

What I had trouble on:
I had trouble figuring out the CORs error, but luckily our team was able to figure it out
at the neck of time


What I am stuck on:
We were stuck on figuring a way to make our system compatible with windows, which
we did not learn until one of our friends with a windows device wanted to try out our system

### Sol Zamora
what I did:
I worked more on the backend. I created a new data table that includes people, emails, passwords, and salts I then had to refactor all of the backend code to account for this new data table. I also implemented code to sign in new users into the databases as well as code for checking their credentials and logging them in.
Lastly, I fixed some bugs in the test suite and added some new ones to check the correctness of the newly implemented functions.

what I learned:
I learned more of the syntax of JavaScript, which I'm still very unfamiliar with. I also learned how to implement a hashing and salting function to secure the privacy of passwords.

What I had trouble on:
I had trouble refactoring all of the code after changing the structure of the SQL database. I had to modify every function we had already implemented to work with the new data tables.

What I am stuck on:
I'm stuck on modifying the server configuration to prevent CORS errors from happening. The frontend and backend are both working correctly independently, but are failing when working together. This error is proving difficult to debug.



## Plans for next week:
1. We wil have compeleted all of the endpoints for the API
2. We will have compelted all of the test that are needed for the API and the backend as needed
3. We will have compelted the functionality of the webpages in which we will have for the website in
   which we are working with
