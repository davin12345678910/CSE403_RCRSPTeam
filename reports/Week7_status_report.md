### Sol Zamora
what I did:
I worked more on the backend. I created a new data table that includes people, emails, passwords, and salts I then had to refactor all of the backend code to account for this new data table. I also implemented code to sign in new users into the databases as well as code for checking their credentials and logging them in.
Lastly, I fixed some bugs in the test suite and added some new ones to check the correctness of the newly implemented functions.

what I learned:
I learned more of the syntax of JavaScript, which I'm still very unfamiliar with. I also learned how to implement a hashing and salting function to secure the privacy of passwords.

What I had trouble on:
I had trouble refactoring all of the code after changing the structure of the SQL database. I had to modify every function we had already implemented to work with the new data tables.

What I am stuck on:
I'm stuck on modifying the server configuration to prevent CORS errors from happening. The frontend and backend are both working correctly independently, but are failing when working together. This error is proving difficult to debug.



## Plans for next week:
1. We wil have compeleted all of the endpoints for the API
2. We will have compelted all of the test that are needed for the API and the backend as needed
3. We will have compelted the functionality of the webpages in which we will have for the website in
   which we are working with
