# Week 9 status report for Sahil

## Team report:
### Status update:
Overall out team has been able to refactor out codebase to be more readable on the backend. In addition, we now have a website where users can simply
put in the link and start using our application. We however, do not have all
of the user names and passwords for all people, which prevented users from
peer reviews to login and we hope to solve this issue later.


### Agenda for thursday's meeting:
We will be going over the final use cases that we will need to implement, and discuss any use cases that we do not think we can do. And we will be discussing them with Sahil. We will also be discussing the suggestions that we will be getting from peer reviews in order to see what some potential users thought about our application.

## Contributions of team memebers:

### Davin Win Kyi:

what I did:
I helped with the commenting of the methods, endpoints and tests.
I also assisted with the public release of the backend code for our website.

what I learned:
I learned about hosting a public server. I also learned about various commenting techniques in javascript, which overall are quite similar to the commenting techniques of java code.

What I had trouble on:
We had trouble hosting the backend code initally, but were eventually
able to figure it out

What I am stuck on:
Getting a way to have changes in the code, but it not crashing or impacting the public website. This is something that we can fix by having pull request, which our team unfortunately did not do
