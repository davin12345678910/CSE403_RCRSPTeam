# Week 5 status report for Sahil

## Team report:
### Status update:
So far our team is currently working on the brainstorming of the front end and the back end of our application. We are determining the best services to use for our back end and the best way to structure our API which we will be making. In terms of the front end, we are determining the best wesbite formats as well as determining the best accessibility features for our website so that all stuents can use our application.

One thing that we have yet to have agreed on is a weekly meeting time, though we have set up a when2meet to resolve this.

### Agenda for tuesday's meeting
1. The front end team and the back end team will discuss their design decisions, and as needed, we will be adjusting the design plans we had on each team in order to have a smooth connection between the front end and the backend
2. We will be scheduleing times for pair programming
3. We will check in with @sahil on our progress
4. Further concerns and comments


## Contributions of team memebers:

### Davin Win Kyi:
I worked on the majority of the document in terms of the beginning answers, and made revisions as needed. I also am working on the front end design for the team as well.

### Azaan Khalfe
I helped with the ER digaram with end points, the coding guideline the risk assessment and with the project schedule. What worked is group meetings are productive when they happen, but there must be some goals set so there is not much off-topic discussion. I learned how important designing the system is and how much background research is needed to think about designing, after spending time designing hopefully implementing will be a lot easier. It is a little hard to come up with the whole system while not coding the actual system. I am stuck trying to flush out the whole backend system and try to implement it. And how much detail does the backend need?  

### Ahmed Helow
I helped with designing the ER diagram for our database model. As well as deciding on what framework we are going to use to implement our backend server and API. 


### Chairnet Muche
I contributed to the front-end aspect of the document and performed revisions and writing on other sections as needed. I initiated the LoginPage.js to demonstrate its functionality when students input their UW email and password. Currently, I am focused on developing the front-end component of the project.

### Foad Shariat
I helped with the front-end elements needed for the project. I also helped with the design details in the document.
I have seeded the react app with the basic components and have started working on the front-end design.


### Sol Zamora
I contributed to the back-end development and overall design of the system. I also worked on deciding the coding guidelines for each segment of the project/each language we're using. Further, I helped designing and conceptualizing the interactions within ER diagrams.



## Plans for next week:
1. we hope to discuss the progress we have made in getting the outlines for the webpages that we will be using for our website
2. For the backend we hope to have a server that has endpoints that are mostly complete and might add more during our next meeting as needed
