# CSE403_RCRSPTeam
We are a team of computer science students working on a Resilient Course Registration System for CSE 403


## Idea of our project: 
We are making an app that is building on top of the current registration system of the UW that we hope will improve the experience of registrarting for classes for users. For example, we hope to make the add in code process more streamlined then the current process where you have to ask advisers, then later get the people who you can contact, then contact the person, then wait for a response where you might be asked to give more information, and possibly not end up with the code. As you can see this process is very time consuming and not that nice for the user. We hope to make a more streamlined process that is embedded into the current registration system where you can easily contact the needed people and get quicker responses as it is a one stop shop. As for those who give add codes, given that the request won't be in their emails, which may be hidden within the many thousands of other emails it makes it easier for everybody! 


## Goals: 
1. Make a tool that is more accessibile for users 
2. Make a tool that has a more streamlined add in code process 
3. Make a tool that expands the capabilities of the current system to improve the UI
4. Make a tool that is more transparent with users when they are registering 
5. Make a tool that includes all of the ratings and previous grades of a class 


## Layout of the repository:
###    Server directory: server portion of the code 
`Server.java` : this is the java file that contains all of the Server code that we will need
    
###    Client directory: client portion of the code 
`index.js`: This is file which boostraps the whole application and because it's a react application all the components will be loaded inside this file
###    Webpages: this is the place where we will have the layout of each of the pages
**Class Webpage** : this is the place where we will have all of the code for the layout of the class webpage
**MainPage Webpage** : this is the place where we will have all of the code for the layout of the MainPage webpage 
**SearchEngine Webpage** : this is the place where we will have all of the code for the layout of the SearchEngine webpage 
**Submission Webpage** : this is the place where we will have all of the code for the layout of the Submission webpage 
      Note: for each of these Webpages you want to have a css file where you will have all of the code for the formatting and the 
        style of the webpage. And we will have a javascript file where we will have all of the functionality as well as the code 
        that will build up the html of the webpage
